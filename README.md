# Learn-k8s

A collection of working examples and refernces to educational materials about Kubernetes.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  Think of it as an orchestrator for containers.  It takes care of things like: Â  

* **Scheduling:** Deciding where your containers run.
* **Scaling:** Increasing or decreasing the number of running containers.
* **Service Discovery:** How your applications find each other.
* **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across your containers.
* **Rolling Updates:** Updating your application with minimal downtime.
* **Self-Healing:** Restarting failed containers.
